# GLua Patches

This is a collection of GLua patches for Garry's Mod that fix trivial issues and add useful features that should frankly be officially implemented in the game by default.

To see what each patch does, read the `readme.md` in each directory.

**NOTE**: These patches make the assumption that they're only being ran once, thus they should be to avoid patches being applied more than once.
