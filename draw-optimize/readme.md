# draw-optimize

This rewrites a bunch of drawing functions from the `draw` library to be slightly faster.

This was ~~stolen~~ borrowed directly from [JetBoom](https://github.com/JetBoom)'s [Extreme Football Throwdown](https://github.com/JetBoom/extremefootballthrowdown/blob/master/gamemodes/extremefootballthrowdown/gamemode/buffthefps.lua) gamemode, but it can be used in just about anything.
