# hook-expensive-clean

This removes a bunch of expensive hooks that aren't really needed.

This was ~~stolen~~ borrowed directly from [JetBoom](https://github.com/JetBoom)'s [Extreme Football Throwdown](https://github.com/JetBoom/extremefootballthrowdown/blob/master/gamemodes/extremefootballthrowdown/gamemode/nixthelag.lua) gamemode, but it can be used in any gamemode not derived from Sandbox.
